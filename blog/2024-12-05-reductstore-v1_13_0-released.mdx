## What's new in 1.13.0?

This release introduces a new conditional query API that should significantly improve your experience when querying or removing records. The new API allows you to use logical and comparison operators to filter records by labels.
Previously, you could only filter records by labels using the `include' and `exclude' options, which were limited to exact matches. This means that you had to classify your records in advance at the ingest stage to be able to filter them later.
Now, all you have to do is label your records with metric labels and then use the conditional queries to filter them by any condition you want.
