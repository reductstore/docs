Efficient and effective storage of vibration data is important to a wide range of industries, particularly where accurate and complex predictive maintenance or optimization is required.

This blog post looks at best practices for managing vibration data, starting with storing both raw and pre-processed metrics to take advantage of their unique benefits. We'll explore the differences between time series object stores and traditional time series databases, and highlight optimal data flow processes.

We'll also cover strategies for eliminating data loss through volume-based retention policies, guide you through setting up an effective data retention frameworks.

## Store Both Raw and Pre-Processed Metrics
Maintaining both raw data and pre-processed metrics such as RMS (Root Mean Square), peak-to-peak and crest factor can be beneficial for several reasons.

- Raw data provides the detailed granularity required for in-depth diagnostics and future algorithm development.

- Pre-processed metrics provide immediate insight into equipment condition without the need for heavy computation.


### Benefits of Pre-Processing Before Storage
The main advantage of pre-processing metrics is that it significantly reduces storage requirements by summarizing raw data into key metrics.

For example, a signal can be divided into 1 second chunks and the result would be a new signal value at 1Hz that summarizes the content of each chunk.

**TODO**: picture showing signal in chunks

The typical metrics include:

- **RMS (Root Mean Square)**: Represents the power content of the signal by calculating the root of the mean square.

- **Peak-to-Peak**: Measures the difference between the maximum and minimum values, indicating the signal's amplitude range.

- **Crest Factor**: The ratio of the peak value of the signal to its RMS value, indicating how sharp or sudden the peaks in the signal are.

This approach also saves time during data analysis... Pre-processing data into these metrics allows for faster analysis and retrieval because there is simply less data to process.

### Advantages of Storing Raw Data
Storing raw data in the context of vibration monitoring offers significant advantages. Raw sensor output stored as a blob captures the full fidelity of the original signal, allowing extensive post-processing and re-analysis using different algorithms or filters.

This flexibility is essential for developing new diagnostic tools or improving existing ones without the need for repeated data acquisition. For example, raw data can be used to perform detailed frequency analysis using FFT, detect spikes using time domain analysis, identify signal variations using wavelet transform, find faults in rotating equipment using envelope analysis, and understand structural vibrations using modal analysis.

**TODO**: Example of an FFT image

Raw data retention also ensures compliance with industry standards that require traceable and verifiable records for audit purposes.

## Time Series Databases
Time Series Databases (TSDBs) are specialised data storage systems optimised for handling time-indexed data. They excel at managing large volumes of sequentially generated data points, such as vibration measurements, by providing efficient write and read operations.

### Time Series Object Store vs. Traditional Time Series Database
A time series object store and a traditional time series database can serve similar purposes, but have distinct architectural differences. While a traditional TSDB is optimised for high-speed ingestion and retrieval of scalar data points, an object store is designed to handle complex, high-dimensional data objects and their metadata. This makes the object store more versatile for applications that require rich contextual information, such as vibration analysis that includes waveform data and diagnostic logs.

### Data Flow With a Time Series Object Store
With a time series object store, each chunk of vibration data is stored as a binary object with a timestamp along with metadata such as preprocess metrics that can be useful for filtering and replication (more on that later).

**TODO**: schema of data flow

This method allows efficient management of large vibration datasets by providing fast access to specific time periods. In fact, [**ReductStore outperforms TimescaleDB for blobs 100KB and larger**](<https://www.reduct.store/blog/comparisons/iot/reductstore-vs-timescaledb>) using this method, with improvements ranging from 205% to 1300%.

## Eliminate Data Loss
By storing raw sensor data locally, we minimize latency and retain critical information for immediate diagnosis.

However, local storage can quickly fill up at the edge, leading to potential disk bottlenecks. To prevent this, we need to periodically eliminate data. However, this data may be critical for further analysis or diagnosis.

Automated replication of important data chunks is therefore essential to ensure that critical information is retained.

### Volume-Based Retention Policy
A real-time FIFO (first-in, first-out) quota prevents disk space shortages in real time. Typically, databases implement retention policies based on time periods; in the case of ReductStore, retention can be set based on data volume. This is particularly useful when storing vibration sensor data on edge devices with limited storage capacity.

Time-based retention can lead to data loss during downtime. For example, if a system retains data for seven days and goes offline over the weekend, it might only capture five days of data before starting to overwrite. Additionally, if the device is offline for a long time, it could delete all existing data once restarted, losing important information.

By configuring a volume-based retention policy, you can ensure that all hours of operation are captured without interruption due to downtime or storage limitations.

### Data Replication Based on Pre-processed Metrics
By preprocessing vibration data to extract key metrics such as peak amplitude, frequency content, and RMS values, the system can prioritize these summarized metrics for replication.

**TODO**: replication image

This approach ensures that critical diagnostic information is preserved even if the raw data must be dropped due to storage constraints.

## Conclusion
Implementing a robust vibration data storage strategy is critical for effective monitoring and diagnostics in industrial applications.

Time series object stores such as [**ReductStore**](<https://www.reduct.store/>) offer significant advantages over traditional TSDBs by efficiently managing vibration data in chunks.

Volume-based retention policies and automated data replication ensure critical information is retained while minimizing storage constraints at the edge.

By pre-processing and prioritizing metadata for replication, critical diagnostic data remains accessible even if raw data is overwritten.

This approach improves operational efficiency and ensures compliance with industry standards that require traceable and verifiable audit trails.
