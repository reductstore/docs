## Concepts

ReductStore provides a strait-forward access management based on token authentication and permissions.

### Token Authentication

ReductStore uses token-based authentication to secure the API. A client must send a valid token in the `Authorization` header to access the API.
A ReductStore instance must have an initial token to access the API. This token is used to create other tokens and manage the instance. The token is configured with the `RS_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

Tokens are immutable and can't be updated. If you need to change the token, you must create a new one and update the clients with the new token. The value of the token is a random string which is generated when the token is created and available only at that time.

:::info
In case, when you don't need the access control, you can disable the token authentication by leaving the `RS_API_TOKEN` unset.

### Permissions and Access Control

Each token has a set of permissions that define what actions can be performed with the token:

- `full_access`: Allows the token to perform any action on the API.
- `read`: List of buckets permitted to read.
- `write`: List of buckets permitted to write.

## Managing Tokens

Here you will find examples of how to create, list, retrieve, and delete access tokens using the ReductStore SDKs, REST API, CLI and Web Console.

Pay attention that all the examples are written for a local ReductStore instance available at **`http://127.0.0.1:8383`** with API token `my-token`.

For more information on setting up a local ReductStore instance, see the **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.mdx)** guide.
