ReductStore is available as a [SaaS offering](/solutions/cloud), allowing you to deploy ReductStore instances on-demand without managing the underlying infrastructure. This guide provides information about the architecture and instructions for deploying ReductStore as a SaaS instance on ReductStore Cloud.

## Overview

The ReductStore Cloud uses a multi-tenant architecture on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) clusters.
Each instance is isolated from others and stores data in a dedicated GCS (Google Cloud Storage) bucket.
