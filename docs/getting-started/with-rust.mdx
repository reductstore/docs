## Installing the Rust SDK

<InstallSdk>
    To start using the ReductStore Rust SDK, add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    reduct-rs = "1"
    ```

    Then, import the `reduct-rs` crate in your Rust code:
</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Hello World Example

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create a ReductStore client, you can use the `Client::builder()` method from the `reduct_rs` crate to create a builder
    instance. You must pass the URL of the ReductStore server as an argument to the `ClientBuilder::new()` method.
    Then, call the `build()` method on the builder instance to create a `Client` instance:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=1. end=2.
    ```
</CreateClientSection>

## Create a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>

    To create a bucket, you should use the `GetOrCreateBucket` method on a `Client` instance. Pass the name of the bucket
    you want to create as an argument, along with settings.  If the bucket already exists, the `GetOrCreateBucket`
    method will return it:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=2. end=3.
    ```
</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped record to an entry in a bucket, you should use the `Write` method on a `Bucket` instance.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument, along with the timestamp you want to write.
    The `Write` method will call a callback function with the `WritableRecord` instance to write to the entry:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=3. end=4.
    ```
</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `Query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the entry to iterate over, and `start` and `stop` arguments to specify the time interval. The method will
    a callback function with the `ReadableRecord` instance for each record in the time range:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=4. end=5.
    ```
</DataQueryingSection>
