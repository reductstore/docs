## Installing the C++ SDK

<InstallSdk>
    To install the ReductStore SDK, you will need to have C++ 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. Once C++ is
    installed, you can use the `pip` package manager to install the `reduct-py` package:

    ```
    pip install reduct-py
    ```
</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Hello World Example

<UsingSdkSection example={QuickStart} language="cpp"/>

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create a ReductStore client, you can use the `Client` class from the `reduct` module. Pass the URL of the
    ReductStore instance you wish to connect to as an argument to the `Client` constructor. To reuse the same HTTP
    session and improve performance, you can use the context manager:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=1. end=2.
    ```
</CreateClientSection>

## Create a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>

    To create a bucket, you should use the `create_bucket` method on a `Client` instance. Pass the name of the bucket
    you want to create as an argument, along with settings. You can set the `exist_ok` argument to True to get the
    bucket if it already exists:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=2. end=3.
    ```
</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped record to an entry in a bucket, you should use the `write` method on a `Bucket` instance.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument, along with the data and timestamp you want to write.
    The `write` method will create the `sensor-1` entry if it doesn't exist and write the record to it:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=3. end=4.
    ```
</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the record to iterate over, and `start` and `stop` arguments to specify the time interval. The `query'
    method
    returns an async iterator over the records in the entry:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=4. end=5.
    ```
</DataQueryingSection>
